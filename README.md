### Technical Writing Portfolio â€“ Words of Wisdom (WoW)

Hi,

I am Vijay! Here, you will find the links to some of my tutorials on `SAP HANA Cloud`.

As an aspiring technical writer, I would love to hear your feedback on any of these work samples.

#### Tutorials

- While working as a Learning and Enablement Intern for `SAP HANA Cloud` at SAP, I published the following tutorials 
on the SAP Tutorial Navigator website:

1. [**Data Anonymization in SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database**](https://developers.sap.com/group.hana-cloud-database-data-anonymization.html)

    *Learn how to use data anonymization capabilities in `SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database` to access data that was previously available yet not accessible due to data privacy rules and regulations.*

2. [**Python Analysis with Multi-Model Data in SAP HANA Cloud**](https://developers.sap.com/group.hana-cloud-database-python-multi-model.html)

    *Learn about the enhancements made to the hana-ml library to support the multi-model capabilities of SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database.*

3. [**Get Started with a Standalone SAP HANA Cloud, Data Lake**](https://developers.sap.com/mission.hana-cloud-data-lake-get-started.html)

    *Learn the basics of working with a standalone `SAP HANA Cloud, data lake`, from provision the data lake, loading data, monitoring the data lake, and performing backup and recovery.*

#### Workshop Series on SAP HANA Cloud

- As part of [SAP HANA Cloud Workshop series on Collaborative Database Development](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServletV2?target=reg20V2.jsp&eventid=3342381&sessionid=1&key=E81F3BBAD36BF0C5BE73AFBC18EF81CD&groupId=2764517&sourcepage=register), I created the workbook (.pdf file) for each of the three sessions. The workbooks are a step-by-step guide for all the instructions that were part of the workshop sessions. These instructions were later re-designed as a tutorial group.

You can watch the recording of the above workshop session held during SAP TechEd 2021.
