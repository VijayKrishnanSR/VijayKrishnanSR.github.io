### Technical Writing Portfolio â€“ Words of Wisdom (WoW)

Hi,

I am Vijay! Here, you will find the links to some of my tutorials on SAP HANA Cloud.

As an aspiring technical writer, I would love to hear your feedback on any of these work samples.

While working as a Learning and Enablement Intern for SAP HANA Cloud at SAP, I published the following tutorials 
on the SAP Tutorial Navigator website:
