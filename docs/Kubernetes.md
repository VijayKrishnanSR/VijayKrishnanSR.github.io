### What is Kubernetes?

In today's world, software applications play a significant role in driving great experiences that foster long-lasting trust between the customer and the company. [According to a study](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf), companies that focus on deploying applications with speed and agility have achieved elite performance over their competitors. In the search for improving the deployment rate, the use of micro-services has risen as the smartest option. The performance of micro-services depends on the efficient allocation of resources within containers. Containers are instances of an image (template) that contain a writable layer to run applications. Kubernetes,the container management platform, is one of the best solutions available on the market that offers high efficiency in resource allocation. **What is the business value derived from adopting Kubernetes?**

#### - **Fast-to-market**

Kubernetes allows for faster deployment rates through the adoption of micro-services. The [case study on CUBE Bikes](https://www.kubermatic.com/customers/cube-bikes/) reveals how the implementation of Kubernetes considerably improved the frequency of releases and updates. With regards to a competitive market **to be fast means, to be first!**

- **Scalability**

In the real world, the **success of an application largely depends on its scalability**. For a service that experiences dynamic user load according to changing business scenarios, Kubernetes offers the capability to scale up or down the computing power. This feature not only optimizes the resources allocated to individual applications but saves CPU usage and thereby drives down the costs incurred. The [case study on Vorwerk Temial](https://www.kubermatic.com/customers/t-systems-mms-and-temial/) explains the story of how a scalable infrastructure fosters reliability by reducing complexities.

- **Flexibility**

Another benefit of using Kubernetes is that it is compatible across all environments, be it a cloud or a virtual machine. This offers a great advantage for companies that want to follow a multi-cloud strategy and avoid the lock-in effect leveraged by infrastructure and cloud providers. Being a 100% open-source project, Kubernetes provides you the **flexibility to switch providers based on their quality of service and your business requirements**.

- **Cloud Migration**

Applications can be moved seamlessly from on-premise to cloud environments using Kubernetes as it offers consistent support across all environments. This is extremely beneficial to companies **preparing for their cloud transformation journey** as disclosed in the [case study on DialogData](https://www.kubermatic.com/customers/dialog-data/).

- **Community Support**

As one of the most widely used container management solutions, Kubernetes has a highly trusted and proven underlying architecture. The rapid growth, adoption, and popularity of Kubernetes among all other solutions have resulted in the rise of **a strong community of active users providing continuous support**. The [large and active userbase of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/community/) provides a broader scope for collaboration and development. Kubernetes provides high flexibility to meet the needs of a wide range of users by supporting various programming languages, workloads, and frameworks.
