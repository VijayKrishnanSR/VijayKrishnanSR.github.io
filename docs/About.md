As an Electronics Engineer with a master's degree in Business Administration, I am interested in building sustainable knowledge ecosystems within organizations.
I am curious about how people learn, which motivates me to transform complex information into meaningful and engaging learning experiences. These learning solutions help employees acquire and develop skills and competencies that drive revenue growth in the organization. Always looking forward to new opportunities and challenges.

Currently, I am working in the role of a Learning Experience Specialist for 3DEXPERIENCE Works to enable and onboard new hires in sales, tech-sales, and marketing departments.

I like to explore new technologies and learn about their complexities, advantages, and limitations so that I can present them in a way that everyone understands easily. As a Learning Enablement Intern at SAP, I worked towards helping customers and employees learn about the latest technical features of SAP HANA Cloud and how to use them productively. As a working student in the SAP Cloud Success Services Learning team, I strived to motivate employees to consume engaging learning programs that were designed to improve cloud skills and align with company strategy.
