I am curious about how people learn, which motivates me to transform information into meaningful and engaging learning experiences. These experiences help learners acquire skills and competencies which lead to an organization achieving its goals.

I like to explore new technologies, learn about their complexities, advantages and limitations, and finally present them in a way that everyone can understand easily. As a Learning Enablement Intern at SAP, I worked towards helping existing and potential customers know about the latest technical features of SAP HANA Cloud and how to use them productively. At present, I am working part-time in the field of Instructional Design and Communication with the SAP Cloud Success Services Learning team. Here, I strive to motivate our learners to consume the engaging learning content made available on our learning platform. As a team, we provide diverse learning opportunities to help employees develop their Cloud skills and pursue career growth.
