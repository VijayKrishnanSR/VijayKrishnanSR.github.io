I am curious about how people learn, which motivates me to transform information into meaningful and engaging learning experiences. These experiences help employees acquire skills and competencies that lead organizations to achieve their goals.

I like to explore new technologies and learn about their complexities, advantages, and limitations so that I can present them in a way that everyone understands easily. As a Learning Enablement Intern at SAP, I worked towards helping customers and employees learn about the latest technical features of SAP HANA Cloud and how to use them productively. At present, I am working part-time in the field of Instructional Design and Communication with the SAP Cloud Success Services Learning team. Here, I strive to motivate employees to consume the engaging learning programs made available on our learning platforms. As a team, we provide diverse learning opportunities to help our colleagues develop their Cloud skills and move their careers forward.

Having completed my master's degree in Business Administration, I look forward to working in a new role where I can hone my skills and learn new ones.
